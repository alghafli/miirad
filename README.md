# miirad
Track incomes and expenses.

Miirad is a simple program made for small entities which need to record their incomes and expenses. Now it is only made with an Arabic interface and not translation ready but that may change in the future to allow everybody to use it.

Features
========

- Web interface. Work with it using the browser and if required, work with multiple computers over the network.
- Regular backups in case you mess things up (under implementation).
- Get a report on your incomes and expenses (under implementation).
- Categorize invoices.
- Can use Gregorian or Hijri calendar.
- Have a separate database for each entity you track its incomes and expenses.

What Miirad lacks
=================

- Translation support to present the interface for multiple languages. This may change in the future.
- A nice interface. It needs better CSS and may be better HTML.
- Miirad is not made for large organizations.
